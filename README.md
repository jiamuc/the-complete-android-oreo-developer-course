Description
The Complete Android 8.0 Oreo Developer Course by Rob Percival and Nick Walter

Learn Android App Development with Android 8.0 Oreo by building real apps including Twitter, Instagram and Super Mario Run.

Wish you’d thought of Whatsapp/Instagram/Google Maps?

Me too.

But until I work out how to build a time machine.

Here’s the next best thing. 

The Complete Android 8.0 Oreo Developer Course

Kicking things up a notch from my smash-hit The Complete Android N Developer Course (59,000 students + 8,500 five star ratings) -- my latest course is your fast-track, skip-the-queue ticket to building high-calibre Android apps.

Because, let’s face it… you’re busy. You want results. And you don’t have time to hang around.

And while you wait for that big idea, developers in the US are making an average of $95,000 a year… 

 “Excellent instruction and content. Continuously building apps keeps me engaged and drives the lessons home nicely.”

“So far it's a great tutorial for beginners! You learn a lot of concepts in short videos and hence it's not boring. You get to make a lot of apps which makes it lot more practical and interesting!”

“I'm a senior android developer already but this course has been a huge help in revising all the basics and making the android knowledge foundation even stronger.”

Why choose me?

My name’s Rob Percival, Udemy’s bestselling coding instructor. 

I believe that if YOU succeed, so do I.  That’s why for the last five years I’ve dedicated my life to building courses that get my students coding and building apps as quickly and efficiently as possible. 

With 22 courses (and counting), and half a million students to my name - I’ve built a multi-million dollar business helping people learn to code. I’d love you to join my community and start seeing all the wonderful benefits coding can bring to your life, too.

And if you don’t like what you learn? I offer a 30-day money-back return. No questions asked. 

Let’s dig in.

“This course was absolutely the best thing that ever happened to me. Learned literally everything I needed in android app developing. Looking forward to take other courses from Rob Percival. A special thanks to him as well for making this course. Wish I could've given more than 5 STARS!”

What’s so good about Android 8.0 Oreo?

“Safer, smarter, more powerful and sweeter than ever!”

Whether you’re looking to usher in the next generation of smart TVs, fitness wearables, games consoles, game-changing AI, smartwatches -- or just build simple apps for good old fashioned fun -- Android 8.0 Oreo is your key to unbridled creativity.

And the potential market right now?

IS HUGE.

The Play Store gives you access to a massive commercial audience with one active billion users downloading apps, last year alone.

But, I digress.

Fresh from Google’s workshop, Android 8.0 Oreo is stable, feature-rich and functional as ever. Not only can you develop more efficiently, but you’ll get new ways to extend your app. 

All you need is the right idea, or that lucky bit of exposure -- and your ‘big break’ might just be around the corner…

So join my Android 8.0 Oreo revolution today and here’s what you’ll get

Learn all the new features to Android Oreo, like Adaptive Icons, Picture-in-Picture, Downloadable Fonts and Virtual Reality with Daydream.
Dive into Augmented Reality with our ARCore section. Learn how to mix the physical and digital world through a user's camera.

BONUS MINI COURSE: Get your free mini course on Kotlin. Kotlin is new programing language you can use in place of Java when making android apps. It’s gaining more and more support and is an essential skill as an Android developer.

“Amazing!! I couldn’t believe that I could develop android apps after taking this course.”

“Best teacher I`ve ever met on the internet. Wish I could give you 6 stars. Keep it up man.”

“I'm loving the speed at which the course moves through the material. As someone who learns best by trying things out for myself, this has been a huge leap forward in my skill level..”

“Unlike every other course in android and Java, this one includes many hands on coding projects that teach you how to REALLY build the stuff you want to build.”

And that’s not all folks! You’ll also get my BONUS BUNDLE to support you through your learning journey…

Because I want you to have the vERY best start in your Android journey, I’ve put together a bonus bundle packed with everything you need to kick things off fully equipped and ready for action.

Normally, this entire bundle of extras, bonuses and support would cost $$$$$$$$ for one year’s access.

However, if you sign up today, you’ll get LIFETIME ACCESS to the course materials, downloads and of course, important updates. 

All for just one pocket-friendly payment of $200. 

Not a penny more.

What have you got to lose?

“Simple, easy to follow, and being able to check Q&A for other people's questions and progress makes it more fun to learn.”

“Excellent explanations. Easy-going attitude. I've done 2 popular Android courses on Udemy and this course had much clearer explanations than the other course I tried. I'm surprised how quickly we were able to build cool apps.”

“I learnt not only how to program but also how to reduce complexity, lines of code, code readability and many other helpful programming techniques.”

Why take this course?

For the last three months, my team and I have been diligently exploring, interrogating and appraising Android 8.0 Oreo.

“I could not have went to a better course to start with android native development. It offers everything I wanted in my app and also provides ample opportunities to engage learner in an efficient implementation of what one has learnt. Highly recommended.”

 

“Amazing course! Just finished the Tic Toe app and still going on. Being a 4+ years experienced Java developer, i can tell that this is extremely well explained. Thanks Rob!”

“For me, this is an excellent course. If you want to learn how to create Android apps without all the hassle of learning the entire history of Android, this course is a must.
